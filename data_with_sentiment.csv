Elemental,buenas esta e mi opiniã³n de elementos la pelãcula de elementos la disfrute bastante la verdad e que encantã³ yo voy dar mi punto de vista de como se tiene que ver la pelãcula ya que tambiãn hablarã de un punto que hace que falle para mã opiniã³n en la pelãcula tienes que centrarte en el romance de los do protagonistas que surge medida que avanza la trama en la toma de decisiones de la protagonista ya que hace que sea el conflicto de la pelicula para mi en la pelãcula la protagonista tiene que estar dãndose cuenta de lo que verdaderamente quiere gracias al personaje secundario que hace replantear al protagonista de que si e lo que quiero tambiãn el ambiente del lugar que se llega sentir e precioso encantador algo que tiene que ver del ambiente e que hay varios tema que toca por ejemplo identidad pertenencia migraciã³n discriminaciã³n xenofobia etc lo cual tambiãn no hace reflexionar bastante de cã³mo e nuestro entorno que clase de persona somos si somos persona prejuiciosas narcisistas muchos mãs ejemplos de ser desconsiderado otra clase de persona si somos persona empãticas honestashumildas muchas mãs bueno ya pasando al otro punto que e muy negativo para la pelãcula serãa si no tomamos como conflicto la tuberãas ya que la pelãcula e muy absurda deja vacão ese tema hace parecer que quisieron difundir mucho en ese tema quisieron resolverla de la forma mãs vaga menos trabajada posible tambien el padre que para mã e el antagonista ya que en la peli se opone la prota le evita nada de hecho en la cinta se nota que la ama la quiere que darãa todo por ella hice que para mi esta cinta tiene villano para mã como dije e verlo de solo pensar en el romance que hay que en los 3ros factores conclusiã³n parece una buena pelãcula pero con un conflicto explicado que hace que falle pero que se quiere el romance que hay entre los do protagonistas la recomendarãa para verla solo 3 veces si quieres una vez al aão peor e una pelãcula perfecta ni horrible pero que si te llega gustar muchãsimo te culpo 45 en realidad serãa un 35 pero gustã³ mucho la peli robo el corazã³n mucho texto,-1.0,negative
